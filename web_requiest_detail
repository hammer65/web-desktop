requestId

string. The ID of the request. Request IDs are unique within a browser session, so you can use them to relate different events associated with the same request.

url

string. Target of the request.
method
string. Standard HTTP method: for example, "GET" or "POST".
frameId
integer. Zero if the request happens in the main frame; a positive value is the ID of a subframe in which the request happens. If the document of a (sub-)frame is loaded (type is main_frame or sub_frame), frameId indicates the ID of this frame, not the ID of the outer frame. Frame IDs are unique within a tab.

parentFrameId

integer. ID of the frame that contains the frame which sent the request. Set to -1 if no parent frame exists.

requestBodyOptional

object. Contains the HTTP request body data. Only provided if extraInfoSpec contains "requestBody".

errorOptional

string. This is set if any errors were encountered when obtaining request body data.

formDataOptional

object. This object is present if the request method is POST and the body is a sequence of key-value pairs encoded in UTF-8 as either "multipart/form-data" or 
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
It is a dictionary in which each key contains the list of all values for that key. For example: {'key': ['value1', 'value2']}. If the data is of another media type, or if it is malformed, the object is not present.

rawOptional

array of webRequest.UploadData. If the request method is PUT or POST, and the body is not already parsed in formData, then this array contains the unparsed request body elements.

tabId

integer. ID of the tab in which the request takes place. Set to -1 if the request isn't related to a tab.

type

webRequest.ResourceType. The type of resource being requested: for example, "image", "script", "stylesheet".

timeStamp

number. The time when this event fired, in milliseconds since the epoch.

originUrl

string. URL of the resource that triggered this request. Note that this may not be the same as the URL of the page into which the requested resource will be loaded. For example, if a document triggers a load in a different window through the target attribute of a link, or a CSS document includes an image using the url() functional notation, then this will be the URL of the original document or of the CSS document, respectively.
